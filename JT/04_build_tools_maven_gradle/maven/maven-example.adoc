== Creating a Maven Project

* Let's create a new Maven project. From the Welcome Screen select New Project, or if you already have an IntelliJ IDEA project open, select *File -&gt; New -&gt; Projectâ€¦*

[.text-left]
image::maven-project-images/create-new-project.png[width=40%]

We can optionally choose a maven archetype to use to create the project. If you're creating a simple project, you don't need to select an archetype. Press *Next.*

* You need to give the project a name, and you can optionally set the location. If you click on *Artifact Coordinates* you'll see more Maven settings.

Press *Finish*, and IntelliJ IDEA will generate the Maven *pom.xml* for you.

== Understanding dependencies

In *pom.xml* we can add manually new dependencies or generate this (clicking on *Generate* option from the Code menu).

[.text-left]
image::maven-project-images/generate-dependency.png[width=40%]

You can see all your declared dependencies in the *Maven* window. Nested under those we've declared, you can see the dependencies they themselves rely on.

To add new profiles in Maven, you can define them within the *'profiles'* section of your pom.xml file

[source,xml]
----
 <profiles>
    <!-- Development Profile -->
    <profile>
        <id>development</id>
        <properties>
            <environment>development</environment>
            <database.url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db</database.url>
        </properties>
    </profile>

    <!-- Production Profile -->
    <profile>
        <id>production</id>
        <properties>
            <environment>production</environment>
            <database.url>jdbc:mysql://prod.example.com:3306/prod_db</database.url>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>   
----

In this example, we have two profiles:

- development

- production. 

Each profile sets different properties, such as the database URL, based on the environment.

*Activate profiles: Profiles can be activated in several ways:*

* *Explicit Activation:* You can explicitly activate a profile using the -P command-line option followed by the profile ID. For example, to activate the development profile, you can run Maven with -Pdevelopment.

* *Automatic Activation:* Profiles can also be automatically activated based on certain conditions such as the presence or absence of a file, a JDK version, an operating system, or an environment variable. You can use the <activation> element within a profile to specify these conditions.

== Add a new module

[source,xml]
----
  <modules>
        <module>maven-submodule-example</module>
    </modules>
----

In Maven tab it looks like:

== Examples of adding specific plugins to a pom.xml:

Maven Compiler Plugin - This plugin is used to compile the source code of your project.

[source,xml]
----

<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
        <configuration>
            <source>1.8</source>
            <target>1.8</target>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----

Maven Failsafe Plugin - This plugin is used to run integration tests of your project.

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
   <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
   </plugin>
</plugins>
----

Maven Release Plugin - This plugin is used to automate releases of your project.

[source,xml]
----
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0-M1</version>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----

Let's consider an example where you want to include the spring-core dependency but exclude its transitive dependency on commons-logging. Here's how you would declare this dependency with exclusion in your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.15</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
            <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

Maven allows you to manage versions of dependencies using various version control mechanisms. For example, you can specify a version range or use the latest.version placeholder to automatically use the latest available version. Here's an example of using version ranges:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
    <version>[3.0,)</version>
</dependency>
----

This declaration ensures that Maven will use any version of Apache Commons Lang 3.x, where x is equal to or greater than 3.0.

== Maven Commands:

[.text-left]
image::maven-project-images/mvn-commands.png[width=40%]

* *mvn clean:*

This command cleans the build directories, removing all built files and directories.

* *mvn compile:*

This command compiles the source code of the project.

* *mvn test:*

This command runs the tests for the project. It compiles the test classes and executes them.

* *mvn package:*

This command packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.

* *mvn install:*

This command installs the packaged artifact into the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects on the same machine.

* *mvn deploy:*

This command deploys the packaged artifact to a remote Maven repository, making it available for other developers or projects.

* *mvn clean install:*

This command cleans the project, compiles the source code, runs tests, packages the artifact, and installs it into the local Maven repository.

* *mvn dependency:tree:*

This command generates a dependency tree for the project, showing all dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

* *mvn help:effective-pom:*

This command generates the effective POM (Project Object Model) for the project, showing the final configuration after inheritance and interpolation.

* *mvn archetype:generate:*

This command generates a new Maven project from an archetype (a project template).

* *mvn site:*

This command generates project documentation and reports, such as project reports, test coverage reports, and Javadoc.

* *mvn release:prepare:*

This command prepares for a release by creating a release branch, updating version numbers, and running tests.
