A *constructor* is a block of codes similar to the method.
It is called when an instance of the class is created.

At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

TIP: Every time an object is created using the *new()* keyword, at least one constructor is called.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class.
In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

== Rules for creating constructor

There are two rules defined for the constructor:

* Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
* A constructor must have no explicit return type.
* A constructor cannot be abstract, static, final and synchronized.

== Types of constructors

In Java, constructors can be divided into three types:

Default constructor::

A constructor that has no parameters is known as '_default constructor_'.
* A default constructor is invisible.
* And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor.

TIP: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

====
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
====

No-args constructor::
If a constructor does not accept any parameters(arguments), it is known as a '_no-argument constructor_'.

Parameterized constructor::
A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a '_parameterized constructor_'.
* *Overloading constructor*

*** Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists.
*** They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task.
*** They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

TIP: The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects.
