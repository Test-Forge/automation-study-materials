In the Java programming language, an *object* is an instance of a Java class, meaning it is a copy of a specific class.

== Primary characteristics

Java objects have three primary characteristics: *identity, state, and behavior*.

These characteristics are the building blocks of any class object and set the scene for how they are used.

Identity::: The identity of an object is a unique identifier, such as a memory address, ID, or even a name.
State::: Represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior::: Object behavior is used to describe what an object can do, such as a fan turning on or off or changing speeds
