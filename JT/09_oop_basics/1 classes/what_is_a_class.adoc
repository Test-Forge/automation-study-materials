*A class* (in the context of Java) is a template to create objects and to define object data types and methods.

----
Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category.
----
----
Class is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/behavior and common properties/attributes.
----
----
Class is a group of variables of different data types and group of methods.
----

Java provides a keyword named class by which we can declare a class. Inside the class, we define _class members_ and _functions_. It is not possible to create Java programs without class.

We can also refer a class as a user-defined data type because an object-oriented paradigm allows us to model real-world objects.


=== Types of classes

There are seven types of classes in Java:

* Static class
* Final class
* Abstract class
* Concrete class
* Singleton class
* POJO class
* Inner class

=== Parts of classes

A class declaration is made up of the following parts:

* Modifiers
* Class name
* Superclass (the name of a class' parent, if available)
* Implemented Inheritances (if any)
* Appropriate keywords depending on whether the class extends from a _Superclass_ and/or implements one or more interface
* Class body curly brackets *{}*

=== Class content

A class in Java can contain:

* Fields
* Methods
* Constructors
* Blocks
* Nested class and interface

=== Constructor in classes

Constructors are used to create and initialized new objects in class.

=== Method in classes

A method is like a function which is used to expose the behaviour of an object.


=== Constructor vs Method
.There are many differences between constructors and methods.

|===
|Java Constructor |Java Method

|A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object
|A method is used to expose the behavior of an object

|A constructor must not have a return type
|A method must have a return type

|The constructor is invoked implicitly
|The method is invoked explicitly

|The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class
|The method is not provided by the compiler in any case

|The constructor name must be same as the class name
|The method name may or may not be same as the class name
