TIP: The word *final* means that cannot be changed.

Once declare a class as _final_, the values remain the same throughout the program.

The purpose of the final class is to make the class *immutable* like the String class.
It is only a way to make the class immutable.

* The final class cannot be extended.
* Prevents the class from being sub-classed.
