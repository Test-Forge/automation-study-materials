Writing clean code in Java is crucial for maintaining readability, reusability, and overall code quality.
Here are some key principles specifically related to clean code practices and naming conventions in Java:

=== Meaningful Names

* *Intention-Revealing Names:* Names of variables, methods, and classes should reveal why they exist, what they do, and how they are used.
For example, `createUserAccount` is more descriptive than just `create`.
* *Avoid Disinformation:* Do not use names which mislead the reader about the nature of the entity.
For instance, avoid using `list` as a name for a variable that is not actually a `java.util.List`.
* *Make Distinctions Meaningful:* Different names should mean different things.
Avoid using names that vary in small ways like `Product` and `ProductInfo`.
* *Use Pronounceable and Searchable Names:* Names should be easy to pronounce and search.
Avoid acronyms and abbreviations that are not standard.

Bad Example:

[source,java]
----
int d; // elapsed time in days
----

Good Example:

[source,java]
----
int elapsedTimeInDays;
----

The good example uses a name that clearly states what the variable represents without needing additional comments.

=== Functions

* *Small and Focused:* Functions should be short and limited to a single task.
Each function should ideally be no more than 20 lines long.
* *Do One Thing:* Functions should do one thing only and do it well.
If a function is doing multiple tasks, consider breaking it into smaller functions.
* *Descriptive Names:* Function names should clearly state what they do; if you find yourself needing to add comments to explain what a function does, consider renaming the function.

Bad Example:

[source,java]
----
public void email(String address) {
    // Check if email is valid
    if (address.contains("@")) {
        // Send email
    }
}
----

Good Example:

[source,java]
----
public void sendEmailToAddress(String emailAddress) {
    if (isValidEmail(emailAddress)) {
        // code to send email
    }
}

private boolean isValidEmail(String emailAddress) {
    return emailAddress.contains("@");
}
----

The good example shows functions doing one thing: `isValidEmail` checks for email validity, and `sendEmailToAddress` handles the sending process.
This makes the functions easier to understand and reuse.

=== Comments

* *Use Comments Wisely:* Comments should be used to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done; the code itself should be clear enough to show what is happening.
* *Avoid Redundant Comments:* Do not use comments that are redundant with what can be clearly seen in the code; for example, avoid comments like `i++; // increment i by 1`.

Bad Example:

[source,java]
----
// Increment x
x++;
----

Good Example:

[source,java]
----
// Compensate for boundary offset
x++;
----

The good example provides a reason why the operation is necessary, which is not evident from the code alone.

=== Formatting

* *Consistency*: Stick to a consistent coding style regarding indentation, braces, whitespace, etc.
This can often be enforced using tools like linters or formatters (e.g., Google Java Style Guide or Checkstyle).
* *Logical Organization:* Order methods and class variables logically.
For example, place public methods before private ones, group similar functions together, and follow a consistent order for getters and setters.

Example of Consistent Formatting:

[source,java]
----
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;

    public Car(String make, String model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void startEngine() {
        // code to start the engine
    }

    // Private methods are placed after public methods
    private void stopEngine() {
        // code to stop the engine
    }
}
----

This example is well-formatted with clear and consistent indentations and method organization.

=== Error Handling

* *Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes:* Using exceptions for error handling can make the code cleaner and more readable, as it separates the error handling from the main logic.
* *Don't Ignore Exceptions:* Catch only those exceptions that you can actually handle meaningfully.

Bad Example:

[source,java]
----
try {
    // code that might throw exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // do nothing
}
----

Good Example:

[source,java]
----
try {
    // code that might throw exception
} catch (SpecificException e) {
    log.error("Handling exception with specific recovery.", e);
}
----

The good example catches only a specific exception and includes meaningful error handling, like logging the error.

=== Classes

* *Small and Focused:* Like functions, classes should also be small and focused on a single responsibility.
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change.
* *Encapsulation:* Hide internal details and expose operations that allow others to manipulate the internal state through methods.

Example of a Well-Designed Class:

[source,java]
----
public class UserManager {
    private List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }

    public User findUser(String username) {
        for (User user : users) {
            if (user.getUsername().equals(username)) {
                return user;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

public class AuthenticationService {
    private UserManager userManager;

    public AuthenticationService(UserManager userManager) {
        this.userManager = userManager;
    }

    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = userManager.findUser(username);
        return user != null && user.getPassword().equals(password);
    }
}

----

In the example above each class has one reason to change.
If the process of user management changes, it affects only `UserManager`.
If authentication logic changes, only `AuthenticationService` needs to be updated. +

`UserManager` controls how user data is accessed and manipulated, hiding the details of the user list from other classes.
`AuthenticationService` manages how authentication is performed, using `UserManager` through a well-defined interface.

=== Naming Conventions

* *Class Names:* Should be nouns (e.g., `Customer`, `Account`), and use CamelCase with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.
* *Method Names:* Should be verbs (e.g., `deletePage`, `save`) and use lowerCamelCase.
* *Constant Names:* Should be in all uppercase letters with underscores between words (e.g., `MAX_HEIGHT`).
* *Variable Names:* Use lowerCamelCase and choose names that reflect their purpose.

Example of Naming Conventions:

[source,java]
----
public class Bicycle {
    private static final int MAX_SPEED = 20; // constant
    private int currentSpeed;

    public void increaseSpeed() {
        if (currentSpeed < MAX_SPEED) {
            currentSpeed++;
        }
    }
}
----

Here, class names, variable names, method names, and constants all follow Java's naming conventions.

[NOTE]
Following these principles helps to maintain and understand Java code more effectively, making it easier for developers to work individually and as a team.
