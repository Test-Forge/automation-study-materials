= Singleton class

A *singleton class* in Java is a special class that allows only one instance (or object) of itself to be created (exists).

=== How to create a singleton class

To create a singleton class, a class must implement the following properties:

* Create a *private* constructor of the class to restrict object creation outside the class.
* Create a *private* attribute of the class type that refers to the single object.
* Create a *public static* method that allows us to create and access the object we created.
Inside the method, we will create a condition that restricts us from creating more than one object.

====
Singleton is a design pattern rather than a feature specific to Java.

A design pattern is like our code library that includes various coding techniques shared by programmers around the world.
