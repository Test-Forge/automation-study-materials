OOP stands for *Object-Oriented Programming*.

=== What is a OOP

OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of *objects* to represent and manipulate data.

In OOP, data is encapsulated within _objects_, and objects are defined by their _properties_ (attributes) and _behaviors_ (methods).


=== Advantages of OOP

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

* OOP is faster and easier to execute
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
* OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "_Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself_" (DRY), and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
* OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
