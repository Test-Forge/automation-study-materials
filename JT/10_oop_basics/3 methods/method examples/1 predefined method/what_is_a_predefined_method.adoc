In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as *predefined methods*.

TIP: It is also known as the *standard library method* or *built-in method*.

We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point.

Some pre-defined methods are *length(), equals(), compareTo(), sqrt()*, etc.

When we call any of the predefined methods in our program, a series of codes related to the corresponding method runs in the background that is already stored in the library.

Each and every predefined method is defined inside a class. Such as *print()* method is defined in the _java.io.PrintStream class_.

It prints the statement that we write inside the method. For example, *print("Java")*, it prints Java on the console.
