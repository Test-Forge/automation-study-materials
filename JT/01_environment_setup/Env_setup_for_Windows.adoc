=== SDK, Maven

Java SDK::
The Java Software Development Kit (*SDK*), also known as the Java Development Kit (*JDK*), is a comprehensive suite of tools for developing Java applications.
It _includes the Java Runtime Environment (*JRE*)_, a _compiler_, a _debugger_, and other utilities.

Maven::
*Apache Maven* is a build automation and dependency management tool primarily used for Java projects.
It _simplifies the build process_, _manages project dependencies_, and _ensures consistent_ builds across different environments.

. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21[*Download*] and
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA[*install*] Java SE Development Kit:
+
image::resources/SDK-01.png[]
+
*In our case, this is version 21* as LTS, and we choose this one.
+
After that, https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[download] and https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-maven-windows[install] Apache Maven or another type of building tool.
+
image::resources/maven-01.png[]

. Set up Java and Maven as Environment variables:
+
Press [_Win + Q_] and type '_envir_' for example:
+
image::resources/SDK-02.png[]
+
Click on '*Edit environment variables for your account*', choose the tab [*Advanced*] and click on the '**Environment Variables** ...' button:
+
image::resources/SDK-03.png[]
+
Here you will create System variable (or Edit them in case they already exist).
+
* *JAVA_HOME*: add as value the path where *you have installed Java 21 earlier* (for example, _C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.2_)
* *M2_HOME*: add as value the path where *you have unzipped the archive earlier* (for example, _C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.6.3-bin_)
+
image::resources/SDK-04.png[]
+
Now look for the System variable called Path and edit its content.
Add to this the following arguments if they do not already exist: _%M2_HOME%\bin; %JAVA_HOME%\bin_
+
image::resources/SDK-05.png[]

. Check to see that you have set up Java and Maven correctly:

* Open a command line interface (*CLI*): (Press [_Win + R_] and type '_cmd_' and press '_Enter_')
+
image::resources/SDK-06.png[]

* Check Java version by running the command: _java -version_
* Check Maven version by running the command: _mvn -version_
+
TIP: If it looks like below, then you are all set up correctly! Versions may differ in your case, but the main thing is that there are no errors.

=== Git

Is a distributed version control system _used for tracking changes in source code_ during software development.
It facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing multiple versions of a project to be maintained simultaneously and efficiently merging changes.

. https://git-scm.com/download/win[*Download*] and install Git:
+
Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it's already installed, it's probably a good idea to update to the latest version.

. Set up Git:
+
_If you have Git on your system_, you'll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment.
You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they'll stick around between upgrades.
+
TIP: _You can also change them at any time_ by running through the commands again.
+
Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates.
+
_These variables can be stored in three different places:_

- *_[path]/etc/gitconfig_ file:*
+
Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories.
If you pass the option _--system_ to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.
Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.

- *_~/.gitconfig_ or _~/.config/git/config_ file:*
+
Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the _--global_ option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on your system.

- *config file in the Git directory (that is, _.git/config_) of whatever repository you're currently using:*
+
Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the _--local_ option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.
+
Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in [path]/etc/gitconfig.
+
TIP: You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git config --list --show-origin
----
+
**Your Identity**
+
_The first thing you should do when you install Git_ is to set your username and email address.
+
[NOTE]
=====
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
=====
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email john.doe@endava.com
----
+
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the _--global option_, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.
If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the _--global_ option when you're in that project.
+
**Your default branch name**
+
_By default_, Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with git init. From Git version 2.28 onwards, you can set a different name for the initial branch.
+
_To set main as the default branch name, do:_
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
----
+
[NOTE]
If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git config --list
user.name=John Doe
user.email=john.doe@endava.com
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
color.interactive=auto
color.diff=auto
...
----
You can also check what Git thinks a specific key's value is by typing git config <key>:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git config user.name
John Doe
----

=== [[intellij-idea]]IntelliJ IDEA

. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[*Download*] and install IntelliJ IDEA:

+
image::resources/idea-01.png[]

. Set up IntelliJ IDEA:
+
* Open IntelliJ IDEA.

Click on "_Accept_" to proceed:
+
image::resources/idea-02.png[]
+

+
image::resources/idea-03.png[]
+
. Install plugins for IntelliJ IDEA:
+
* Gherkin
* Cucumber for Java
+
image::resources/idea-04.png[]
+
Set up the new project in IntelliJ IDEA or create a new one from existing sources
+
You should have a link to the project repository. If you don't have it, ask your team lead for it.
+
*OR:*

=== [[postman]]Postman

*Postman* is an app for interacting with HTTP APIs.
It presents you with a friendly GUI _for constructing requests and reading responses_.

But Postman recently changed their software to remove the Scratch Pad mode, which means that all configuration data,
including _Collections and Environments_, is uploaded to Postman's cloud servers.

This poses a **potential security risk** for many projects. To avoid storing collections in a Postman account,
users are advised to uninstall their current version of Postman and install an older version using the following https://go.pstmn.io/dl-win64-v9-latest[link].

. https://go.pstmn.io/dl-win64-v9-latest[*Download*] and installPostman for Windows (64-bit):
+
image::resources/postman-02.png[]
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not sign up or log in and don't Update software for security reasons.
====
+
Requests are the foundation of Postman, as they are used to test APIs. Over time, the number of requests will increase, and it can become challenging to navigate through them. Therefore, it's essential to organize requests into collections. Collections can be thought of as folders for storing requests. Organizing collections is a significant topic, and it's something that might be discussed in an interview. In short, collections should have a logical structure and be organized based on a certain criterion, such as the version of the API being tested or a specific block of functionality.
+
Both requests and collections can be created using the "New" button in the upper left corner of the interface.
+
Postman collection with endpoints and environments set up will be provided by your project team lead.

=== [[winscp]]WinSCP

WinSCP (Windows Secure Copy) is a free and open-source file transfer client for Windows.
