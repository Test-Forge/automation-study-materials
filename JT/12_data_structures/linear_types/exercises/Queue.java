/*
Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure
        - Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
        - Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
        - Peek: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
        - isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
        - isFull: Checks if the queue is full.

1. Easy level
    Write a program to remove an item from the Queue
    Create a Queue (imlement using a Linked List), add 7 integer elements, remove the last number
    and print the resulting Queue

2. Medium level
    The Java code checks whether the queue of characters is a palindrome or not.
    A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
    Try to resolve task using two queues
