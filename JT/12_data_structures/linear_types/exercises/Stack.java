/*
1. Easy level
    Write a Java program to create a stack with String type, add 5 elements to it
    and print the contents of the stack.

2. Medium level
    Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
    Note: An input string is valid if:
        Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
        Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
        Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type
