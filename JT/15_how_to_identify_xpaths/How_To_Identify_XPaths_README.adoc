== Introduction to XPath: Navigating the Web Landscape

`XPath (XML Path Language)` is a query language used for navigating XML documents.
Is a crucial component in automating interactions with web pages through tools like Selenium WebDriver.
It's primarily employed for locating and manipulating elements on a webpage, offering a versatile and powerful approach for automation scripting.

'''

=== XPath Syntax Demystified: Absolute vs. Relative Paths

XPath's expressions can be categorized into absolute and relative paths.
Absolute paths begin from the root node, while relative paths initiate from the current node.
This flexibility enables developers to tailor their element identification strategies based on the structure of the HTML document.

üìöAbsolute XPath:

* Starts with a single forward slash `/` and follows the hierarchy of the HTML structure.

```xpath
/html/body/div[1]/input
```

üìöRelative XPath:

* Doesn't start from the root element.
It starts from anywhere within the document.

```xpath
//input[@id='username']
```

'''

=== Strategies for Element Identification: Using Attributes and Hierarchy

* Using Attributes:

Identify elements based on their attributes (e.g., `id`, `class`, `name`).

```xpath
//*[@id='username']
```

* Using Element Hierarchy:

Traverse the HTML hierarchy to locate the desired element.

```xpath
//div[@class='container']//input[@name='password']
```

Text-based XPath: Beyond Attributes for Element Recognition Locate elements based on their visible text.

```xpath
//*[text()='Login']
```

XPath Axes: Navigating the HTML Universe Use axes like following, preceding, parent, etc., to navigate to different parts of the HTML structure.

```xpath
//div[@class='container']/following-sibling::div
```

== Common XPath Patterns: A Cheat Sheet for Element Identification

XPath cheat sheet with examples that you can use as a quick reference for identifying and locating elements on a webpage.

=== Basic XPath Expressions:

- Select any element

```xpath
//*
```

- Select element by tag name:

```xpath
//div
```

- Select element by ID attribute:

```xpath
//*[@id='exampleId']
```

- Select element by class attribute:

```xpath
//*[contains(@class, 'exampleClass')]
```

In XPath, the `/` and `//` operators are used to navigate through elements in XML/HTML documents.
They have different meanings and behaviours:

* Forward-slash `/`:

- The forward-slash operator selects the immediate childrent of the current node.
- It specifies the direct path to the desired element.
- It starts the selection from the root node or the context node.

```xpath
/html/body/div/p
```

select all `*p*` elements that are direct children of `*div*` elements, which are in turn direct children of the ``*body*`` element, which is a direct child of the `*html*` element.

* Double-slash `//`:

- The double-slash operator selects all elements in the document that match the following selection criteria, regardless of their position in the document hierarchy.
- It specifies a more flexible path to the desired element.
- It starts the selection from the current node, but it can traverse down multiple levels in the document hierarchy to find matching elements.

```xpath
//div//p
```

select all `*p*` elements that are descendants of `*div*` elements, regardless of their level of nesting in the document.

==== Attribute-based Xpath Expressions:

- Select input element with a specific attribute:

```xpath
//input[@type='text']
```

- Select element with a specific value in an attribute:

```xpath
//button[@name='submit']
```

Text-based XPath Expressions:

- Select element containing specific text:

```xpath
//h1[contains(text(),'Industries')]
```

image::images/text_based_xpath_expressions.png[]

==== Hierarchy and Position-based XPath Expressions:

- Select the first child element:

```xpath
//div/*[1]
```

- Select element based on its position in the hierarchy:

```xpath
//div[@class='parent']/child::p
```

```xpath
//form[@class='my-form']/child::input[@id='email']
```

- Select element based on descendant axis `//`

```xpath
//form[@class='my-form']//input[@id='password']
```

image::images/descendat-input-email.png[width=700]

- Select element based on parent axis `/..`:

```xpath
//input[@id='password']/..
```

image::images/parent-axis.png[width=700]

- Select element based on ancestor axis `ancestor::`

```xpath
//input[@id='password']/ancestor::div
```

image::images/ancestor-div.png[width=700]

==== Logical conditions in XPath:

- Select element based on multiple conditions `AND`:

```xpath
//input[@type='submit' and @value='Login']
```

image::images/multiple_conditions.png[width=700]

Wildcards and Functions:

- Select element with an atribute starting with a specific value:

```xpath
//input[starts-with(@id, 'prefix')]
```

- Select element with an attribute containing a specific value:

```xpath
//div[contains(@class, 'my-form__actions')]
```

How to parse a table in Selenium using XPath?

For example, we have the following HTML table structure:

```html

<table class="SpecTable">
    <col width="40%"/>
    <col width="60%"/>
    <tr>
        <td class="LightRowHead">Optical Zoom:</td>
        <td class="LightRow">15x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="DarkRowHead">Digital Zoom:</td>
        <td class="DarkRow">6x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="LightRowHead">Battery Type:</td>
        <td class="LightRow">Alkaline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="DarkRowHead">Resolution Megapixels:</td>
        <td class="DarkRow">14 MP</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

We can parse this table in Selenium using the following Java code:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

import java.util.List;

public class TableParserExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");

        // Instantiate ChromeDriver
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        // Navigate to the webpage with the table
        driver.get("URL_OF_YOUR_WEBPAGE");

        // gets all rows
        List<WebElement> rows = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//table[@class='SpecTable']//tr"));

        // for every row, store both columns
        for (WebElement row : rows) {
            // Select the first td element within the current row
            WebElement key = row.findElement(By.xpath("./td[1]"));
            // Select the second td element within the current row
            WebElement val = row.findElement(By.xpath("./td[2]"));

            // Perform actions with the extracted text
            System.out.println("Key: " + key.getText());
            System.out.println("Value: " + val.getText());
        }

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

How to use `@FindBy` annotation?

For example let`s locate the `Email` field.

image::images/findby-annotation.png[]

In the screen for the `Email` field we can use the `id` locator - `email` as a selector to locate the field.
So, to use it in the code with ``@FindBy`` annotation, we can write it as follows:

```java
@FindBy(id="email")
private WebElement emailField;
```

Similarly, we can use other locator strategies like name, CSS, XPath, etc.

Once we have defined the WebElement, we can directly use it in the methods to act on the element.
The following lines of code show how to interact with the WebElement defined using `@FindBy` annotation:

```java
public void enterEmail() {
    this.emailField.sendKeys("your-email");
        }
```

[IMPORTANT]
XPath's expressions may vary based on the specific HTML structure of the webpage. +
It is recommended to prioritize the use of stable attributes, such as IDs, for more reliable element identification.

== XPath Challenges and Solutions: Troubleshooting in Automation

XPath is a powerful tool for locating elements on web pages, but like any technology, it comes with its set of challenges.
Troubleshooting XPath expressions is a common aspect of web automation, and understanding the challenges and their solutions is crucial for effective and maintainable automation scripts.

[sidebar]
üöß Challenges:

1. Brittleness of XPath:

- XPath expressions based solely on the structure of the HTML can be brittle and prone to break when the page layout changes.

2. Dynamic Content:

- Dynamic content or elements generated by JavaScript can be challenging to locate using traditional XPath expressions.

3. Complex HTML Structures:

- Web pages with complex or nested HTML structures may require intricate XPath expressions, making them harder to read and maintain.

4. Performance Issues:

- XPath expressions that traverse large portions of the HTML document may impact performance, leading to slower test execution.

[sidebar]
üöÄ Solutions:

1. Use Stable Attributes:

- Whenever possible, use stable attributes like IDs or unique classes in your XPath expressions.

2. Dynamic Content Handling:

- For dynamically generated content, consider using partial attribute values or attributes that remain consistent.

3. Simplify XPath with Functions:

- XPath provides functions that can simplify expressions.
For example, using 'text()' to locate elements based on their visible text content.

4. Regular Expressions:

- When dealing with changing attribute values, regular expressions can be employed for partial matches.

5. Page Object Model (POM):

- Implement the Page Object Model to encapsulate the XPath expressions within dedicated classes.
This promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.

```java
public class LoginPage {
    public static final String USERNAME_INPUT = "//input[@id='username']";
}
```

== Future Trends: Evolving Role of XPath in Automation Technologies

[sidebar]
üîë Enhanced Browser Support for Selectors:

- Future versions of browsers and browser automation tools may introduce enhanced support for advanced selectors, reducing reliance on complex XPath expressions.
This could include improved CSS selector capabilities and native support for more efficient element identification

[sidebar]
üîë Machine Learning for Element Recognition:

- Integration of machine learning techniques to automatically generate and optimize XPath expressions based on historical data.
Tools may leverage AI algorithms to adapt and evolve XPath expressions for improved accuracy and resilience against web page changes.

[sidebar]
üîë Visual Testing and AI-Driven Automation:

- The rise of visual testing tools that use artificial intelligence for element recognition.
Instead of relying solely on XPath expressions, these tools may employ image and visual recognition algorithms to identify and interact with elements on web pages.

[sidebar]
üîë Integration with Natural Language Processing (NLP):

- Integration of natural language processing capabilities in automation tools, allowing testers to express element identification criteria in a more human-readable format.
This could lead to the generation of XPath expressions based on plain language instructions.

[sidebar]
üîë Collaboration with Page Object Model (POM):

- Improved integration between XPath-based automation and the Page Object Model.
Automation frameworks may provide more streamlined mechanisms for creating and managing page objects with XPath expressions.
