====
A _Postman Collection_ is a set of API endpoints or requests, along with each endpoint's authorization type, parameters, headers, request bodies, tests, and settings grouped under the same collection ID.

== [[collection]]Creating collections

=== There are several ways to create a new collection:

* Select *Collections* in the sidebar, then select *+*.

* Select *New* -> select *Collection*.
* With *Collections* open in the left sidebar -> select *+*.
* In an empty workspace, select *Create Collection*.
+
TIP: You can also create a https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/using-collections/#using-collection-templates[collection from a template].

=== To customize and configure a new collection, do the following:

* Select the collection name to give your new collection a name.
* You can optionally enter a description for your collection in the *Overview* tab.
+
This https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/[description] will appear in its documentation and in the workspace when anyone opens it.
* Select *Authorization* to configure authorization details for the collection.
* Select *Scripts* -> *Pre-request* to define a https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/[pre-request script] for your collection, which will run before requests are sent to the server.
* Select *Scripts* -> *Post-response* to define a https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/[post-response script] for your collection, which will run after a response is received.
* Select *Variables* to define values for https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/[collection variables] to share across all requests in the collection.

== Collection Runner

====
The _Collection Runner_ enables you to run the requests in a Postman Collection in a specified order to test the functionality of your API.
====

=== Configure a collection run

You can manually run the requests in a link:#collection[collection] or a link:#folder[folder].

* Select *Collections* in the sidebar and select the collection or folder you want to run.
* On the *Overview* tab, select image:resource/icon-runner-v9.jpg[20,20] *Run*.
image:resource/collection-runner-button-v11.jpg[300,300]
* On the *Functional* tab, select *Run manually*.
* If you want your collection to run with an environment, select it using the environment selector at the top right of Postman.
+
You can also select *Environments* in the sidebar, then select the environment you want to use.
* When you've completed your configuration, select *Run* _(collection name)_.
