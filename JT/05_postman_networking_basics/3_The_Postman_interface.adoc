* *Close Tab* - Closes the current tab. If the tab has unsaved changes, Postman asks if you want to save before closing.
* *Force Close Tab* - Closes the current tab without saving any changes.
* *Close Other Tabs* - Closes all tabs except the one you're working in.
* *Close All Tabs* - Closes all tabs. If any tabs contain unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
