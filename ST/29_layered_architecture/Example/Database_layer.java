The data tier is where all the data used in your application are stored.

You can securely store data on this tier, do transaction, and even search through volumes and volumes of data in
a matter of seconds.

It's the lowest tier in the software architecture and houses not only data but indexes and tables as well.
Search, insert, update and delete operations occur here frequently. Application data can store in a file server or
        database server, revealing crucial data but keeping data storage and retrieval procedures hidden.
