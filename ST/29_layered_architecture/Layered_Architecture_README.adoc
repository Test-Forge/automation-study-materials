== Definition of Layered Architecture

The most common architecture pattern is the layered architecture pattern, otherwise known as the n-tier architecture pattern.
This pattern is the de facto standard for most Java EE applications and therefore is widely known by most architects, designers, and developers. 

Components within the layered architecture pattern are organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a
specific role within the application. Request passes through layers from top to bottom and then back up,
and each layer can depend on one or a few layers below it but should not know anything about any layer above it

== Benefits/Drawbacks

*Advantages:*

- _Secure:_ You can secure each of the three tiers separately using different methods.
- _Easy to manage:_ You can manage each tier separately, adding or modifying each tier without affecting the other tiers.
- _Scalable:_ If you need to add more resources, you can do it per tier, without affecting the other tiers.
- _Flexible:_ Apart from isolated scalability, you can also expand each tier in any manner that your requirements dictate.

*Disadvantages:*

- Layers make an application _more difficult to maintain_. Each change requires analysis.
- Layers _may affect application performance_ because they create overhead in execution: each layer in the upper levels
 must connect to those in the lower levels for each operation in the system.

== Typical Layers

IMPORTANT: *Rule-of-thumb:* Use just the layers you need and nothing more !

In the 29_layered_architecture/Example folder you can find more details about each type of layer described below.

. *Presentation layer* contains code related to interaction with the user:
** APIs are exposed here;
** Server-side rendering would also sit here.
. *Persistence layer* takes care of talking to the database:
** Provides interfaces for retrieving and saving data (getUser(id: string), saveUser(user: User));
** Could return simple data transfer objects or instances of business entity classes that actually encapsulate business logic.
[NOTE]
_Try to return something that makes sense from the point of view of the domain, rather than just the structure
of database rows (this way, all stuff specific to the kind of database we use is encapsulated in this layer
and also easy to change)_

. *Business layer* contains business logic to work with entities:
** If persistence layer returns data transfer objects without actual behavior, all business logic will sit here
** If persistence layer returns instances of classes encapsulating business logic, the business layer will call
 methods on those instances as needed and coordinate across multiple instances of potentially multiple classes as
 needed
. *Database layer* is the actual database

[NOTE]
_A layered architecture could have more layers than these if it makes sense_

== Open/closed Layers

An N-tier application can have a closed layer architecture or an open layer architecture.

* In a *closed layer architecture*, a layer can only call the next layer immediately down.
Can be important for security, data integrity
* In an *open layer architecture*, a layer can call any of the layers below it.
Also is called a relaxed layered architecture

[NOTE]
_By default, layers are often considered closed_

== Typical Anti-pattern: lasagna architecture

image::resources/anti_pattern.png[]

Also called _architecture sinkhole anti-pattern._

Lasagna code refers to code whose layers are so complicated and intertwined that making a change in one layer would
necessitate changes in all other layers. Some symptoms:

* Lots of layers
* Large percentage of requests just passed through layers without anything useful happening in most layers

In any layered architecture, this will likely be true for a minority of the requests,
but it becomes a problem if this is the case for a majority of the requests

[NOTE]
_Making some layers open could help solve this_
