== Validation of API Responses in Tests

[TIP]
To ensure the correctness of API responses, it's crucial to compare the received data with expectations.
Verify that the returned data matches the anticipated format, contains the right fields, and aligns with the documented API specifications.
This step helps catch discrepancies that might affect application functionality.

.*Checking HTTP Status Code*
Verify the response's status code to ensure that the request has been processed successfully.

.*Validating Response Structure*
Check if the response structure aligns with expectations, including the correct presence and format of data.
This is particularly important for JSON responses.

.*Comparing Received Data with Expectations*
Compare the data received in the response with the expected values.
Ensure that key information is present and has the correct values.

.*Handling Errors Appropriately*
Implement error-handling logic in tests.
Check how the API responds to invalid requests or specific error situations.

.*Integrating Tests into the Build Pipeline*
Ensure that automated API tests are integrated into your build pipeline to execute them automatically during development.

== Tool and Library Selection

[TIP]
Effective API testing is crucial for ensuring software reliability, and the choice of tools and libraries is paramount in achieving this goal.
Just as a well-selected set of instruments enhances a musical composition, the right testing tools streamline processes, improve coverage, and ensure optimal API performance.
The judicious selection of tools accelerates testing cycles, identifies vulnerabilities, and supports timely software delivery in our dynamic digital landscape.
In essence, the importance of tool and library selection for API testing cannot be overstated.

== Best Practices and Additional Considerations

.*Consistency in Test Data*
[%collapsible]
====
__Maintaining consistency in test data is crucial for reliable and repeatable API testing.
Use consistent and well-defined datasets for your tests to ensure that results remain predictable.
Avoid using live or production data in test environments, as it may introduce variability and impact the accuracy of your tests.
Regularly update and review test data to reflect changes in the application's requirements.__
====

.*Adapting Tests to API Changes*
[%collapsible]
====
__APIs are dynamic and subject to changes over time.
To ensure the longevity of your tests, establish a strategy for handling API changes.
Design tests with flexibility in mind, and use versioning for APIs when possible.
Implement a systematic approach to update tests when API changes occur, ensuring that they remain accurate and effective.
Regularly review and update test scripts to align with the evolving API specifications.__
====

.*Monitoring and Reporting Results:*
[%collapsible]
====
__Effective monitoring and reporting are essential for maintaining a healthy API testing process.
Establish a comprehensive reporting mechanism to track test results, including successful runs, failures, and any issues encountered.
Utilize logging and alerting systems to promptly identify and address test failures.
Implement periodic reviews of test results to identify trends, patterns, or areas for improvement.
Regularly update stakeholders on the status of API tests and collaborate on addressing any issues that may arise.
Continuous monitoring ensures the reliability and effectiveness of your API testing efforts.__

== Best Practices and Additional Considerations

=== For C#

*Step 1:* Create a new .NET project Start by creating a new .NET project in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio.

*Step 2:* Install Required Packages +
Make sure you have RestSharp and your chosen testing framework installed in your test project.

[source,bash]
----
# Install RestSharp
Install-Package RestSharp

# Install NUnit (you can use another testing framework if you prefer)
Install-Package NUnit

----

*Step 3:* Create API client class +
Create a class that will act as your API client.
This class will encapsulate the logic for making API requests.
Here's a simple example:

[source,csharp]
----
using RestSharp;

public class ApiClient
{
    private readonly RestClient _restClient;

    public ApiClient(string baseUrl)
    {
        _restClient = new RestClient(baseUrl);
    }

    public IRestResponse Get(string resource)
    {
        var request = new RestRequest(resource, Method.GET);
        return _restClient.Execute(request);
    }

    // Add methods for other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) as needed
}
----

*Step 4:* Create test class Create a test class where you'll write your test cases.
You can use a testing framework like NUnit or MSTest.
Here's an example using NUnit:

[source,csharp]
----
using NUnit.Framework;

[TestFixture]
public class ApiTests
{
    private ApiClient _apiClient;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        // Initialize the API client with the base URL of your API
        _apiClient = new ApiClient("https://api.example.com");
    }

    [Test]
    public void TestGetRequest()
    {
        // Specify the resource you want to test
        var resource = "/endpoint";

        // Make the API request
        var response = _apiClient.Get(resource);

        // Add assertions based on the response
        Assert.That(response.StatusCode, Is.EqualTo(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK));
        // Add more assertions as needed
    }

    // Add more test methods for other scenarios
}
----

*Step 5:* Run the tests Run your test class to execute the test cases.
Ensure that the API responses meet your expectations.

=== For Java

*Step 1:* Create a new Java project Start by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

*Step 2:* Install Required Dependencies Make sure you have RestAssured and your chosen testing framework installed in your test project.
You can use Maven or Gradle to manage your dependencies.

.For Maven, add the following dependencies to your pom.xml:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
<artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
<version>4.4.0</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
<version>7.4.0</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

.For Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle:
[source,shell]
----
testImplementation 'io.rest-assured:rest-assured:4.4.0'
testImplementation 'org.testng:testng:7.4.0'
----

*Step 3:* Create API Client Class Create a class that will act as your API client.
This class will encapsulate the logic for making API requests.
Here’s a simple example:

[source,java]
----
import io.restassured.RestAssured;
import io.restassured.response.Response;

public class ApiClient {
private final String baseUrl;

    public ApiClient(String baseUrl) {
        this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
    }

    public Response get(String resource) {
        return RestAssured.get(baseUrl + resource);
    }

    // Add methods for other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) as needed
}
----

*Step 4:* Create Test Class Create a test class where you’ll write your test cases.
You can use a testing framework like TestNG or JUnit.
Here’s an example using TestNG:

[source,java]
----
import io.restassured.response.Response;
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeClass;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class ApiTests {
private ApiClient apiClient;

    @BeforeClass
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialize the API client with the base URL of your API
        apiClient = new ApiClient("https://api.example.com");
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetRequest() {
        // Specify the resource you want to test
        String resource = "/endpoint";

        // Make the API request
        Response response = apiClient.get(resource);

        // Add assertions based on the response
        Assert.assertEquals(response.getStatusCode(), 200);
        // Add more assertions as needed
    }

    // Add more test methods for other scenarios
}
----

*Step 5:* Run the Tests Run your test class to execute the test cases.
Ensure that the API responses meet your expectations.

If you use TestNG, you can run your tests directly from your IDE or use the following Maven command:

[source,shell]
----
Copy code
mvn test
----
