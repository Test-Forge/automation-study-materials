=== Introduction

==== Brief Overview: The Significance of Collections in Java

Collections in Java represent a framework that provides an architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. Collections are used to perform various operations such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion. The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces in `java.util` that implement commonly reusable collection data structures. The framework has a variety of interfaces, each with several implementations allowing collections to be viewed and manipulated independently from the details of their representation.

==== General Overview of Java Collections Framework (JCF)
The JCF provides many data structures and algorithms commonly used for dealing with collections. It is designed to offer high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. The main benefits of the Java Collections Framework are that it improves program speed and quality, allows interoperability among unrelated APIs, reduces effort in designing and learning new APIs, and fosters software reuse.

=== Creating Collections in Java

==== Exploring Interfaces and Collection Classes (List, Set, Map, etc.)

In Java, the Collections Framework defines several interfaces and classes. There are four main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework `List`, `Set`, `Map` and `Queue`.

* `List` is an ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements. Elements in a list can be accessed by an _int_ index. Implementations include `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, etc.
* `Set` is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. Implementations include `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, etc.
* `Map` holds key-value pairs, with unique keys and associated values. Implementations include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, etc.
* `Queue` is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing. A typical queue processes its elements in a first‐in, first‐out order, but other orderings are possible.  Implementations include `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`.

==== Examples of Creating Collections: ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, LinkedList

Creating collections in Java is straightforward and involves invoking the constructor of the implementing class. Here are examples for `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` and `LinkedList`:

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
----

==== Features of Using Generics in Collections

Generics in Java allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with placeholder types, and specify the actual type when using them. This feature provides stronger type checks at compile time and eliminates the need for type casting. With generics, you can ensure that your collection only holds objects of a specific type. For example:

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); // can only contain Strings
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // can only contain Integers
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // keys are Strings and values are Integers
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>(); // can only contain Integers
----

Using generics with collections makes your code safer and clearer, as it explicitly states what types of objects are stored in your collection.

=== Operations with Collections in Java

==== Fundamental Operations: Adding, Removing, and Accessing Elements

Collections in Java provide a rich set of methods to perform various operations. Here are the common operations:

* *Adding Elements:* Collections often offer `add` or `addAll` methods. For example, `list.add(element)`, `set.add(element)` or `collection.addAll(anotherCollection)`.
** _Using add:_ This method is used to add a single element to a collection.

[source,java]
----
    collection.add(element);

    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.add("Element1");
    list.add("Element2");
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    set.add("Element1");
    set.add("Element2");
----

[circle]
** _Using addAll:_ This method is useful for merging two collections or adding multiple elements to a collection at once.

[source,java]
----
    collection.addAll(anotherCollection);

    List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("E", "N", "D"));
    List<String> list2 = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "V", "A"));
    list1.addAll(list2); // list1 now contains [E, N, D, A, V, A]
    Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
    Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6));
    set1.addAll(set2); // set1 now contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
----

* *Removing Elements:* Similar to adding, collections provide `remove` or `removeAll` methods, e.g., `list.remove(element)` or `set.remove(element)`.
* *Checking Size:* The `size` method returns the number of elements in a collection.

[source,java]
----
int size = collection.size();

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>;(Arrays.asList("E", "N", "D"));
int size = list.size(); // size is 3
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>;(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
int size = set.size(); // size is 3
----

* *Accessing Elements:* Lists allow accessing elements by their index using the `get` method, e.g., `list.get(index)`. Sets don't support indexed access due to their nature.

==== Working with Iterators for Collection Traversal

Iterators are used to traverse collections in Java. Each collection provides an iterator that can be used to iterate through the collection's elements:

[source,java]
----
Iterator<String> iterator = collection.iterator();
while(iterator.hasNext()){
    String element = iterator.next();
    // process the element
}
----

* _Using forEach:_ This method provides a streamlined approach to iterate over collections, making code cleaner and more readable. It is especially useful with lambda expressions.

[source,java]
----
  collection.forEach(element -> {
        // Process each element
        });

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Helga", "Elena", "Natalia");
  names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); // Prints each name in the list
Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
  numbers.forEach(number -> System.out.println(number)); // Prints each number in the set

Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
  map.put("Ion", 25);
  map.put("Petru", 30);
  map.put("Ana", 23);
  map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + " is " + value + " years old."));
----

==== Code Examples for Operations with Different Collection Types

For Lists:

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Element1");
list.add("Element2");
String element = list.get(0); // Accessing the first element
----

For Sets:

[source,java]
----
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add("Element1");
set.add("Element2");
set.remove("Element1"); // Removing an element
----

For Maps:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Key1", 1);
map.put("Key2", 2);
int value = map.get("Key1"); // Accessing value by key
----

For Queues:
[source,java]
----
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
System.out.println(queue.offer(10)); // true
System.out.println(queue.offer(4));  // true
System.out.println(queue.peek());    // 10
System.out.println(queue.poll());    // 10
System.out.println(queue.poll());    // 4
System.out.println(queue.peek());    // null
----

=== Sorting Collections in Java

==== Introduction to Sorting: Significance and Principles

Sorting is a fundamental operation that organizes elements of a collection in a certain order. The ability to sort collections efficiently is crucial for many applications that require quick search operations or ordered data presentation.

==== Sorting Using Collections.sort() and Comparable

The `Collections.sort()` method is used to sort lists in Java. To use this method, the elements of the list must implement the `Comparable` interface, which requires defining the `compareTo` method. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class User implements Comparable<User> {
    private String name;

    public int compareTo(User other) {
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
    }
    // constructor, getters, and setters
}
List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
// add users to the list
Collections.sort(users);
----

==== Sorting Using Comparator

A `Comparator` is used when you want to sort objects based on multiple fields or when objects do not implement `Comparable`. You can pass a `Comparator` to the `Collections.sort()` method:

[source,java]
----
Comparator<User> comparator = new Comparator<User>() {
    public int compare(User user1, User user2) {
        return user1.getName().compareTo(user2.getName());
    }
};
Collections.sort(users, comparator);
----

==== Examples of Sorting Lists and Arrays

Sorting a list of strings:

[source,java]
----
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Bob");
names.add("Alice");
Collections.sort(names); // Sorts in natural order
----

Sorting an array of integers:

[source,java]
----
Integer[] numbers = {4, 2, 3, 1};
Arrays.sort(numbers); // Sorts in natural order
----

These sorting techniques provide a powerful toolset for managing and organizing data in your Java applications.

=== Filtering Collections in Java

==== Significance and Methods of Filtering Collections

Filtering is a common operation applied to collections when you need to select elements that meet certain criteria. It allows developers to extract subsets of data that match the defined conditions, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in data processing.

==== Using Streams API for Filtering Collections

Java's Streams API, introduced in Java 8, provides a modern and functional approach to processing collections. It offers a declarative way to filter collections:

[source,java]
----
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
List<String> filteredNames = names.stream() // create a stream
    .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")) // apply filter
    .collect(Collectors.toList()); // collect results into a list
----

==== Examples of Filtering Using Lambda Expressions and Methods filter, map, reduce

* *Filter:*

[source,java]
----
  List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream() // create a stream
  .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0) // apply filter if n is even
  .collect(Collectors.toList()); // collect results into a list
----

* *Map:*

[source,java]
----
  List<Integer> doubled = numbers.stream() // create a stream
  .map(n -> n * 2) // apply mapping if n is even
  .collect(Collectors.toList()); // collect results into a list
----

* *Reduce:*

[source,java]
----
  int sum = numbers.stream()
  .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b); // sum all elements of the stream starting from 0
----

=== Best Practices for Working with Collections in Java

==== Tips for Effective Use of Collections

* *Understand your Data:* Choose the right collection type based on the size of the data, the frequency of insertions and deletions, and whether the data needs to be ordered or sorted.
* *Use Generics:* They provide type safety by ensuring that only a specific type of elements can be added to the collection.
* *Prefer Immutable Collections:* Immutable collections are inherently thread-safe and can help to avoid side effects.

==== Avoiding Common Mistakes and Improving Performance

* *Minimize the Scope of Collections:* Keep collections as private as possible. Use unmodifiable wrappers when collections need to be returned.
* *Avoid Premature Optimization:* Use profiling tools to find bottlenecks rather than guessing.
* *Use Lazy Initialization Wisely:* Lazy initialization of collections can save memory and initialization time, but it can also introduce complexity.

==== Examples of Optimizing Work with Large Collections

* *Use Stream API for Parallel Processing:* The Stream API can greatly improve the performance of operations on large collections by utilizing parallel processing:

[source,java]
----
  List<String> largeList = // ...
  List<String> filteredList = largeList.parallelStream()
  .filter(s -> s.contains("important"))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());
----

* *Pagination for Large Data Sets:* When dealing with large datasets, it's often impractical to load all data into memory. Implementing pagination can help in fetching and displaying data in chunks.

By following these best practices and examples, you can ensure efficient and effective use of collections in your Java applications, resulting in cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code.
