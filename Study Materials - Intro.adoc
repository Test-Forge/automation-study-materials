== Study Materials Intro

Welcome, Buddy.
The purpose of this project is to have in a single place a collection of materials that can be used in career path growth.
This project covers technical aspect of first 3 grades (JT,ST,TL).
Under every grade, you can find numerated subjects that will include generic overview, practical code examples, valuable links for deeper exploration, exercises for hands-on learning, and carefully selected memes.

== How can I use these materials?

* On *upskill/reskill* journey: These materials are perfectly suited to start learning from the scratch.
The biggest advantage is that the project can serve as entry point in Automation.
* *Self assessment*: The study materials and exercises can be used for refreshing own knowledge base.
* *Personal growth*: These resources enable you to ensure that you possess all the required technical knowledge to progress to the next grade.
Moreover, on reviewing the materials, there is possible to identify the gaps and area with low practice or expertise, allowing you to dive directly into them.
