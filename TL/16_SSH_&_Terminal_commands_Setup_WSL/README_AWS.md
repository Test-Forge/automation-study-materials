# Creating a Free AWS Remote Host

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a Free Tier that allows you to create and use a remote host (virtual machine) for free, within certain usage limits. This can be particularly useful for educational purposes. Follow these steps to set up a free AWS remote host:

## Step 1: Sign Up for an AWS Account

If you haven't already, sign up for an AWS account by following the instructions in [How to Create a Free AWS Account](#how-to-create-a-free-aws-account).

## Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on **Launch Instance** to create a new virtual machine.
4. Choose an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**. For free tier usage, select an AMI that is eligible for the free tier, such as Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu Server.
5. Choose an **Instance Type**. Select the `t2.micro` instance type, which is eligible for the free tier.
6. Click **Next: Configure Instance Details** and set up the instance as needed.
7. Click **Next: Add Storage**. The default storage options are usually sufficient for educational purposes.
8. Click **Next: Add Tags** if you want to add tags to your instance; otherwise, proceed to the next step.
9. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**. Create a new security group or select an existing one. Ensure that you allow SSH access (port 22) so that you can connect to the instance remotely.
10. Click **Review and Launch**.
11. Review your instance configuration and click **Launch**.
12. When prompted, select an existing key pair or create a new key pair. This key pair will be used to securely connect to your instance via SSH. Download the key pair and keep it safe.

## Step 3: Connect to Your Instance

1. Once your instance is running, select it in the EC2 dashboard and click **Connect**.
